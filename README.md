This is a front-end part of e-commerce site. Created as test assignment. Only desktop version.
I used React JS, HTML, CSS, GraphQL, Apollo, NPM, Git.

- Product description page, product listing page, cart overlay, cart page, currency
  selector, header were created with dynamic content.
- Content data fetching from GraphQL endpoint with Apollo client.
- Implemented functional logic for UI: - adding products to cart from PDP and PLP, - product attribute selection, - cart item quantity increment and decrement in cart overlay and cart
  page, - currency selection, - cart sum calculation, - alerts (e.g., when trying to add to cart out-of-stock products, when some product options are not selected).

Assignment restrictions:

- To use only React class components (Functional components were not allowed);
- No external UI libraries allowed - styling is done with pure CSS and JavaScript.
